# Bayesian Linear Regression
Simple demonstration of Bayesian linear regression 
(assuming the data errors are known and constant, will pursue the
unknown case in the future with Wishart prior).

See the sample image below. The polynomial curve (black)
is fit onto the data (red). Notice that the error bars (blue)
are wider in areas farther from the data used for fitting; this
is the main benefit of using a Bayesian technique instead of
vanilla frequentist regression.
